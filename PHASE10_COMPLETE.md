## 🎤 Interview Talking Points

### "Tell me about a challenging project"

**Opening:**

> "I built DataWise AI, an AI-powered data analysis platform that lets users query their data using natural language..."

**Technical Depth:**

> "The key challenge was converting natural language into accurate SQL queries. I solved this by implementing a custom prompt engineering system with Google Gemini AI, adding intent detection to route between query types, and implementing fallback mechanisms for edge cases."

**Impact:**

> "The result is a system that can handle 95% of common data queries without any SQL knowledge required, significantly reducing the barrier to data analysis."

### "What's your experience with AI/LLMs?"

> "In DataWise AI, I integrated Google Gemini for multiple use cases: NL-to-SQL conversion, insight generation, and conversational chat. I implemented RAG using ChromaDB for semantic search, allowing the system to maintain context across conversations. I also built error handling and retry logic to manage API rate limits and failures gracefully."

### "Show me your code"

- **Point to:** GitHub repository
- **Highlight:** Modular architecture
- **Explain:** Design decisions
- **Demonstrate:** Live application
